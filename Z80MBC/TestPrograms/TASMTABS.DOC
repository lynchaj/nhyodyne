Addressing  modes  are denoted as follows:

        ABS               Absolute
        ZP                Zero Page
        ABS,X             Absolute X
        ZP,X              Zero Page X
        ABS,Y             Absolute Y
        ZP,Y              Zero Page Y
        A                 Accumulator
        (IND,X)           Indirect X
        (IND),Y           Indirect Y
        (IND)             Indirect
        #IMM              Immediate
        REL               Relative (Branch instructions only)
        ZP,REL            Zero Page, Relative
        Implied           Implied

Note  that Zero Page addressing can not be explicitly requested.  It
is used if the value of the operand is  representable  in  a  single
byte for the applicable statements.

The '-x' command line option can be  used  to  enable  the  extended
instructions.  A  '-x'  with  no  digit  following  will  enable the
standard set plus both extended sets.  The 6502 version of TASM uses
three bits in the instruction class  mask  to  determine  whether  a
TASM TABLES  Version 2.9                                   Page 3

given  instruction  is enabled or not.  Bit 0 enables the basic set,
bit 1 enables set A (R65C02) and bit 2 enables  set  B  (R65C00/21).
The following table shows various options:


        Class Mask        Enabled Instructions
                        BASIC   R65C02  R65C00/21
        --------------------------------------------
        1               yes     no      no
        2               no      yes     no
        3               yes     yes     no
        4               no      no      yes
        5               yes     no      yes
        6               no      yes     yes
        7               yes     yes     yes

Thus,  to enable the basic set plus the R65C02 instructions,  invoke
the '-x3' command line option.

See manufacturer's data for  a  more  complete  description  of  the
meaning    of     the     mnemonics    and     addressing     modes.

8048 INSTRUCTIONS AND ADDRESSING MODES

The following list shows the acceptable opcode mnemonics  and  their
corresponding  operand  formats for the 8048 version of TASM.  Where
'Rn' is seen,  R0 through R7  may  be  substituted.  Other  symbolic
fields are as follows:

        SYMBOLIC            DESCRIPTION
        -----------------------------------------------
        <addr8>             Absolute address (8 bits)
        <addr11>            Absolute address (11 bits)
        <immed>             Immediate data

Any valid TASM expression can appear in the  place  of  any  of  the
above symbolics.

The lines that are marked with an (8041),  (8022),  or (8021) on the
far  right are extended instructions that are available only if a -x
option has  been  invoked  on  the  command  line.  The  classes  of
instructions  (and their bit assignment in the class mask) are shown
below:

        BIT     PROCESSOR
        -------------------------------
        0       8X48, 8035, 8039, 8049
        1       8X41A
        2       8022
        3       8021

Thus, to enable the basic 8048 set plus the 8022 set, a -x5 could be
used on the command line.

Note that some of the base instructions should be disabled  for  the
8041, 8022, and 8021, but are not.

TMS7000 INSTRUCTIONS AND ADDRESSING MODES

The following list shows the acceptable opcode mnemonics  and  their
corresponding  operand  formats for the TMS7000 version of TASM.
The following symbolic fields used in the table:

    SYMBOLIC        DESCRIPTION
    -------------------------------------------
    <iop>           Immediate data (8 bits)
    <Rn>            Register file (memory locations 0 to 127 or
                       0 to 255 depending on on-chip RAM)
    <Pn>            Peripheral file (0-255)
    <rel>           Program address (relative)
    <addr>          Program address (16 bit)
    <trap>          Trap number (0-23)

Any valid TASM expression can appear in the  place  of  any  of  the
above symbolics.

Note that TASM allows an alternate syntax for expressing
indirection.  Parenthesis can be replaced with brackets (which are
less ambiguous because they do not occur in expressions).  Thus, the
following are equivalent:

    BR      @addr1(B)
    BR      @addr1[B]

BUILDING TASM FROM THE SOURCE CODE

The TASM   executable  can be  built  using from  the source  if  so
desired.  The first step is to extract the source archive:

        BOOZ TASMSRC.ZOO

Next, use the appropriate MAKEFILE to perform the build:

For Microsoft make:

        COPY MAKEFILE.MSC   MAKEFILE
        NMAKE


For Turbo make:

        COPY MAKEFILE.TC    MAKEFILE
        MAKE

TASM TABLES  Version 2.9                                  Page 46

TASM INSTRUCTION SET TABLE DEFINITION

The tables that control TASM's interpretation of the source file are
read from a file at run time.  The table file name is determined  by
taking  the  numeric option field specified on the TASM command line
and appending it to the string "TASM", then a  ".TAB"  extension  is
added.  Thus, if the following command line is entered:

        tasm -51  test.asm

then TASM would read the table file named "TASM51.TAB".


The following rules apply to the structure of the table file:

        1.  The  first  line  of  the  file  should contain a string
                surrounded by double quotes that should identify the
                version of the assembler  table.  This  string  will
                appear at the top of each page in the list file.  It
                should be limited to 24 characters.
        2.  Any line that starts with a '.' is considered a directive.
                The following directives are available:

                DIRECTIVE       MEANING
                ----------------------------------------------------
                MSFIRST         Generate opcodes MS byte first.

                ALTWILD         Use '@' instead of '*' as the
                                wild card in the table.

                NOARGSHIFT      Suppress the shift/or operation that
                                applies if the optional SHIFT and OR
                                fields are provided.

                REGSET          Define a register mnemonic and
                                associated bit field.

                WORDADDRS       Set word addressing mode (one word =
                                2 bytes)

        3.  Any   line  whose  first  character  is not a '.' and is
                not  alphabetic is considered to be a comment and is
                discarded.

        4.  Any  line  that has an alphabetic character as the first
                character is assumed to be an instruction definition
                record  and  is  parsed  to   build   the   internal
                representation   of   the  instruction  set  tables.
                Eight  fields   (separated  by  white  space)    are
                expected,  as follows:

TASM TABLES  Version 2.9                                  Page 47

                OR              Argument bitwise OR mask

                INSTRUCTION.  The  INSTRUCTION  field should contain
                the string to be  used  as  the  mnemonic  for  this
                instruction.  Upper case letters should be used (the
                source statements are converted to upper case before
                comparison).


                ARGS.   The  ARGS  field  should  contain  a  string
                describing  the  format  of  the operand field.  All
                characters are taken literally except the '*'  which
                denotes  the  presence  of  a valid TASM expression.
                Multiple '*'s can be used,  but all but the last one
                must  be  followed  by  a  comma.  If  a  single '*'
                appears in the ARGS field,  then the default  action
                of  TASM  will  be  to  determine  the  value of the
                expression that matches the field and insert one  or
                two  bytes  of  it into the object file depending on
                the NBYTES field.  If multiple '*'s are  used,  then
                special  operators  (MODOP)  must  be  used  to take
                advantage of them (see the examples below).  An ARGS
                field of a pair  of  double  quotes  means  that  no
                arguments are expected.


                OPCODE.  The OPCODE field should contain the  opcode
                value    (two  to  six  hex   digits)   for   this
                instruction  and  address mode.   Each pair  of  hex
                digits  represent  a  single  byte  of  the  opcode,
                ordered with the right most pair being placed in the
                lowest memory location.


                NBYTES.  The NBYTES field should specify the  number
                of  bytes  this  instruction  is to occupy (a single
                decimal  digit).   This number includes both  opcode
                bytes and argument bytes, thus,  the number of bytes
                of argument is computed by subtracting the number of
                bytes  of  opcode  (dictated by the  length  of  the
                OPCODE field) from NBYTES.


                MODOP.  The MODOP field determines  if  any  special
                operations   need   to  be  performed  on  the  code
                generated for this  instruction.  For  example,  the
                zero-page  addressing  mode of the 6502 is a special
TASM TABLES  Version 2.9                                  Page 48

                case of the absolute addressing mode, and is handled
                by a special MODOP code (see appendix B).  The  list
                of operators is as follows:


                MODOP       DESCRIPTION
                ---------------------------------------------------
                NOTOUCH     Do nothing to instruction or args
                JMPPAGE     Put bits 8-10 of first arg into
                            bits 5-7 of opcode (8048 JMP)

                CSWAP       Combine LS bytes of first two args into
                            first arg and swap.

                MZERO       Motorola (6805) zero page (direct)
                3ARG        Three args, one byte each.
                3REL        Three args, one byte each, last one

                T1          TMS320 instruction with one arg.  Shift
                            according to SHIFT and mask with OR and
                            OR into opcode.  If a second arg exists
                            assume it is an <arp> and OR into   LSB
                            of opcode.
                TDMA        TMS320 instruction with first arg <dma>.
                            Second arg gets shift/and/or  treatment
                            as with T1.
                TAR         TMS320 instruction with first arg <ar>.
                            Second arg gets shift/and/or  treatment
                            as with T1.

                Note  that the reason for the combining of arguments
                (COMBINE and CSWAP) is that TASM  assumes  that  all
                object  bytes  to be inserted in the object file are
                derived from a variable representing  the  value  of
                the  first  argument (argval).  If two arguments are
                in the  ARGS  field,  then  one  of  the  previously
                mentioned  MODOP`s  must  be  used.  They  have  the
                effect of combining the low bytes of the  first  two
                arguments  into the variable (argval) from which the
                object  code  will  be  generated.  TASM`s  argument
                parsing   routine  can  handle  a  large  number  of
                arguments,  but the code that generates  the  object
                code is less capable.

                CLASS.  The  CLASS  field is used to specify whether
                this instruction is part of the standard instruction
                set or a member of a set of  extended  instructions.
                Bit 0 of this field should be set to denote a member
TASM TABLES  Version 2.9                                  Page 49

                of  the standard instruction set.  Other bits can be
                used as needed  to  establish  several  classes  (or
                sets)   of  instructions  that  can  be  enabled  or
                disabled via  the  '-x'  command  line  option  (see
                section on 6502 INSTRUCTIONS AND ADDRESSING MODES).

                SHIFT (optional).   The SHIFT field is used to cause
                the  first  argument of the given instruction to  be
                shifted left the specified number of bits.   (Except
                T1, TDMA, TAR MODOPS as noted below).

                OR  (optional).   The OR field is used to perform  a
                bitwise  OR  with  the first argument of  the  given
                instruction.  Specified as hex digits.  (Except  T1,
                TDMA, TAR MODOPS as noted below).

Note that the SHIFT/OR fields are used somewhat differently for  T1,
TDMA,  and TAR MODOPS.  In those cases,  the SHIFT and OR fields are
used  but the OR field is really an AND mask and the result is  OR'd
with the opcode.

The   following  table   shows   possible    instruction  definition
records,  followed  by  possible  source statements that would match
it,    followed by the resulting object code that would be generated

The  order  of  the  entries for various addressing modes of a given
instruction is important.  Since the wild card matches anything,  it
is  important to specify the ARGS for the addressing modes that have
the  most  qualifying  characters  first.   For   example,   if   an
instruction  had  two  addressing  modes,   one  that  accepted  any
expression,  and another that required a pound sign in front  of  an
expression,  the  pound  sign  entry  should  go first otherwise all
occurrences of the instruction would match  the  more  general  ARGS
expression   that  it  encountered  first.   The  following  entries
illustrate the proper sequencing:

        ADD #*  12 3 NOTOUCH 1
        ADD *   13 3 NOTOUCH 1
